A Supermarket chain is planning to expand operations in the state of Virginia. They want to start off by opening a very successful branch, therefore it is of utmost importance that they choose their initial location wisely. This script will rank the counties in Virginia based on their population, household income, and number of existing supermarkets in the region. By providing the necessary information and presenting it to the board of directors of the Supermarket, they can make a better decision as to where to open the next branch.
